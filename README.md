# XkcdPassword

Commnd line tool for generating XKCD style passwords

The comic mentions a single common word should have 11 bits of entropy so a word list of around 2000 is required.

The packaged word file is from http://www.ingilish.com/2000mostcommonwords.htm with the additions of "battery" and "staple" of course.
